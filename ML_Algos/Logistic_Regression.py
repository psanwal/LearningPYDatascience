# Logistic regression is a way to do classification of data about to which class it belongs.
# 1. If a lona will get default.
# 2. Diseases Diagonosis
# Above classifications are binary in nature.
# Logistic regression plot vary between 0 and 1 with probability on Y axis.
# Sigmoid (aka logitc) functions takes any value and output value between 0 and 1.
# 0.5 or 50% probability acts here as cutoff point. If probability is less than .5 then point belongs to class 0 and vice versa.
# Once we train our classification model, we can evaluate them using confusion matrix.
